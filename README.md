Kathy Lin's (kl2615) Homework 2 Assignment

There are two files in the attached HW2Code.zip file. 

- HW2Funcs.py 
This file contains all the functions needed to run HW2script.py. 

- HW2script.py: 
Note that this script requires running different chunks of the code in order to obtain the error rates of the 4 different representations. For example, you must import HW2funcs first. But make sure to comment out all other 3 representations and leave the data representation you're interested in. Save the script then run it.
